        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer who is celebrated for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognize that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine—making her the world's first computer programmer.
